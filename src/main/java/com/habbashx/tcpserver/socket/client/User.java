/**
 * The User class represents a client application that communicates with a server using SSL sockets.
 * It implements both the {@link Runnable} interface to support threaded operation
 * and resource cleanup, respectively.
 * <p>
 * The class is designed to facilitate secure communication by establishing a connection to the server
 * on a specified port, reading incoming messages, and sending outgoing messages from the user's console.
 * It initializes SSL truststore settings using configuration properties from the {@link ServerSettings} class.
 * <p>
 * Features:
 * - Establishes an SSL socket connection to the server on the provided port.
 * - Handles user input via a {@link UserConsoleInputHandler}, running in a separate thread.
 * - Continuously listens for and processes incoming messages from the server.
 * <p>
 * Threading:
 * - The class runs its operations in a separate thread by implementing {@link Runnable}.
 * - Console input is processed asynchronously using {@link UserConsoleInputHandler}.
