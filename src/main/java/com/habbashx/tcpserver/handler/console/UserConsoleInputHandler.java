 * directs them to the appropriate output stream defined in the associated `User` object.

     * This method continuously listens for messages from the system's standard input (console) through the
     * `BufferedReader` instance assigned to `input`. When a message is received, it is immediately forwarded
     * to the `PrintWriter` instance obtained from the associated `User` object.
     * <p>
     * The method will block on reading input from the console until an input line is available
     * or the stream is closed. If the input is null (indicating end of stream), the loop terminates. In case
     * of an I/O error during reading, the method throws a RuntimeException wrapping the `IOException`.
     * <p>
     * This method is constructed to operate in a separate thread, enabling asynchronous handling of user input
     * without blocking the main application flow.
     *
     * @throws RuntimeException if an I/O error occurs during input reading
